# Frequently asked questions

### Can you attach a GL on weapons that did not support it before (Sniper/MG)?

No, this Mod onls switches between existing Weapon models with and without GL by attaching the GL item.
THis means If a weapon has no GL-counterpart it is not possible to equip it with a GL.

No, as long as there does not exist any Weapon modle with underbarel shotgun you cannot switch to it.
