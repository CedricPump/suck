## Usage

This Mod adds under barrel grenade launchers as items that can be attached to the weapons bipod slot.  
As soon as a supported weapon has a grenade launcher equipped the weapon is switched to its UBGL counterpart.  
The Weapon is switched back by unequipping the UBGL item. Supported grenade launcher weapons are equipped with the UBGL item on pickup automatically.  

Note that the mapping of special weapons (attachments variants) is created by their inheritance hierarchy and my lead to color scheme or barrel length mismatches.
