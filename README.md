## Concept

This Mod should support to attach and detach an UGL.
Because UGL is no attachment like a scope or a Bipod the whole Weapon has to be switched.
Therefore only a limited range of weapons can be suported which have a UGL counterpart.
A mapping of UGL model, base weapon and UGL Weapon is saved an action to attach/detach is shown when current Weapon ist supported.
The UGL itself is represented by an dummy item, that is created on detach and needs to be present for attaching.
