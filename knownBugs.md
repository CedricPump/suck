## SUCK

### logic

- pouch 3ditem is attached to bipod slot on some wespons
- inventory bipod item is visible on some UBGL-Weapons
- if you pickup a exactly same UBGL-Weapon you already have as your PrimaryWeapon for the script it is as if you have removed the bipod-GL and it is switching back to BaseWeapon.
